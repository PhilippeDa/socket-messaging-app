==== how to use ====
1. access localhost:3000 on your browser
2. type a time in second since jan 1st 1970 (UNIX epoch) and a nice message
3. open as many client tab as you like
4. receive the messages when they are due (yay!)

5. optional ( ctrl+c the server while there are still messages in the queue)
6. receive the messages as if the server never was closed! (yay!)


=== pro tip ===
send a message a time 0 so the terminal will send you the time
of the server. copy it and add a few seconds in the client so you dont
have to figure out whats the current time.
